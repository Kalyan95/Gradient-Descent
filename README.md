# Gradient-Descent

Binary Classifier built on 1000 sample datapoints from sklearn.datasets.make_moons with Gaussian Noise.

Make_moons is a 
- A simple toy dataset to visualize clustering and classification algorithms.
- It generates 2d binary classification datasets and they are useful for visualisation. 
- It produces Gaussian data with a spherical decision boundary for binary classification.
