# Gradient-Descent

This project demonstrates a simple logistic regression classifier trained via
gradient descent on the synthetic `make_moons` dataset from scikitâ€‘learn.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Usage

Run the demo script which will train the model and display evaluation metrics
and plots:

```bash
python logistic_regression.py
```

You can adjust the learning rate or number of epochs by editing the parameters
in `logistic_regression.py`.
